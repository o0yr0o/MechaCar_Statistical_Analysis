- Vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11 which is significantly less than the significant level of 0.05. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
